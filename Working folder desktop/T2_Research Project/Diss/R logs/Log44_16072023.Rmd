## Plan today

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Have generated Redux slota and verity markers, need to adjust Harmony script to make the comparisons by loading the correct astrocytes if going for integration at any point.

Issues with Add annotation from ensembl for gene description, ensembl ID and chromosome location âœ… resolved

Need to refine the DEG list process, make script to load it properly and run in one go, have saving blocka s separate to not overwrite each run!

Do some reading

Make a GEO API query to retrieve GEO accession info? Check Simon lectures

venndiagramGenesRelaxed_Verity_Slota_HP.csv has the corssover with the Verity and Slota HP genes without any filtering and wider parameters

venndiagramGenesRelaxed_Verity_Slota_HP_DOWN.csv and venndiagramGenesRelaxed_Verity_Slota_HP_UP.csv has latest filtered lists of interatctions
