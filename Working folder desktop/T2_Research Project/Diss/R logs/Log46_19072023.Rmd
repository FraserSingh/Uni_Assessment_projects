## Plan today

Lightning talk prep

Clean Slota and get new DEG comparison diagrams made

GSEA output investgations

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Lightning talk prep

Nick and I did presentation prep, some good feedback and timings were good, just waiting for slota clean doubletfinder to run to get some visuals for presentation

# Clean Slota script

running doubletfinder taking lots of time as usual

# GSEA

# DEG inspection

Will get top 5 genes shortly for verity and Slota on both ends

Nick has provided a list of gene symbols and enembl IDs which he generated by BLASTing the primers used in a [Liddlelow paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5404890/) to define reactive astrocytes. I will add ot these and check what is coming out of my DEG list to see whether A1 and A2 phenotypes could be seen in our data.

```{r}
Liddelow_markers<-read.csv("C:/Users/frase/OneDrive - University of Edinburgh/Working folder desktop/T2_Research Project/Diss/Liddelow_astrocyte_marker_list_egn.csv")

Verity_markers<-read.csv("C:/Users/frase/OneDrive - University of Edinburgh/Working folder desktop/T2_Research Project/Diss/Outputs/DGEs/Verity_astrocyte_prion_markers_clean.csv")

#Rename column
Verity_markers<- data.frame(external_gene_name = Verity_markers$X, Verity_markers)
Verity_markers$X<-NULL

Verity_markers$Source<-'Verity DEGs'
Liddelow_markers$Source<-'Nick Liddelow list'

gc()

library(dplyr)

shared_markers<-Verity_markers %>% filter(Verity_markers$external_gene_name %in% Liddelow_markers$external_gene_name)
shared_markers
```

findmarkers is having trouble in Slota clean. Turns out the counts slot is normalised and no longer integers. I want to access the raw counts, so might have to load "Rdata/Slo_singlets_merged_clean.Rdata" to check how far back the non integer counts go.

Changing to MAST test was fine.
