## Plan today

Run fastq-dump again to split reads into separte files, try and identify where umi and barcode info could be to use STARsolo.

See log 4 for more info

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Currently not providing STAR with data as reads 1 and 2, do I need to do something to the fastqs? Decided to re run fastq-dump on eddie with a split-3 option to create paired files, then going to run a modified scirpt more similar to Nick's file input. If the split files do not provide umi and bacord info, then I can't run STARsolo properly.

running fasterq-dump \--split-3 ./SRR\* -O ./Split_files_test/ in msc8 screen

This may make the Dumped folder in msc8 redundant, aside fromt he scripts kept therein, so DO NOT MOVE IT OR THE DUMPED FOLDER ON EDDIE SCRATCH SPACE

So the fast files are not splitting into reads because there are so many reads in short read SRA. I will just try cellranger workflow from the start (assembly, mapping etc)

Still elaving the screen running on msc8 in case, check Split_files_test

To save scripts to git from scratch space:

```{bash}
#in top level of scratch space
git add *.sh
git commit -m "<message>"
git push -u Scratch_space_scripts master
