## Plan today

Run Slota rest of workflow, from Clustering

Do the same on Ximerakis

Identify Astrocytes in each for potential subsetting in Harmonisation

## Slota clustering

Getting to the stage of frunning FindMarkers but an issue with geometric mean is stopping me. The issu [has been documented](https://github.com/satijalab/seurat/issues/1570) previously, but no real solution aside from adding a single count to normalised data to eliminate 0 counts. I stuck with this, but need to think through what the statistical significance of this action is.

```{r}

converting counts to integer mode
Error in estimateSizeFactorsForMatrix(counts(object), locfunc = locfunc,  : 
  every gene contains at least one zero, cannot compute log geometric means
```

Could set Verity astrocyte subclustering to be done with the cell annotations from SingleR, as as done in my Slota workflow.

Can use negative binom test.use option

```         
> table(Slo_astrocytes$treatment)

PBS_CX PBS_HP RML_CX RML_HP 
  4298   2148    664    261 
> table(Slo_astrocytes$SingleR.labels.fine)

          Astrocytes Astrocytes activated 
                7360                   11 
```

Need to check for astrocyte subpopulations accoridng to literature then identify which clusters are of interest in Slota to choose which clusters to focus on.

HAve saved DEGs by treatment for Slota. Could do same for Ximerakis.
