Final comparison of Ximerakis QC plots across all present filters to decide on a good candidate to proceed with.

Update Slota script with changes from Ximerakis.

Set up and run slota QC as this is similar to Ximerakis.

Verity Qc will be different, but go off of Nick's guidelines.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

ximarkis paper recommended filters: nUMI\>200, nGene\>250, %Mito\<30. Whilst this does still leave over 50k cells before other filtering, I will restrict to 20% mito as I think the mito content should be lower than 20 % from brief literature searching. I may see from fufther reading that a high threshold is acceptable. Seen below.
