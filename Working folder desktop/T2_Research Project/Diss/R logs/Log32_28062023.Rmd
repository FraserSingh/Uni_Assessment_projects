## Plan today

Read integration and Harmony requirements to begin integration

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Running clustering on Verity on msc8

As seen [here](https://static-content.springer.com/esm/art%3A10.1186%2Fs13059-019-1874-1/MediaObjects/13059_2019_1874_MOESM3_ESM.pdf), The use of SCtransofmr does not need prior use of NromaliseData, so I am removing this in my Verity scripts and will do the same in theximerakis scripts too. The branched version of the Verity script will likely also have this, so this must be reomved eventually during merge. Re-running the doubletfinder loop.

[This guide](https://www.singlecellcourse.org/single-cell-rna-seq-analysis-using-seurat.html#basic-quality-control-and-filtering) shows that a scrublet dataset has no reductions, meaning that I can indeed re-run reductions etc. on an SCTransform assay.

need to set assay to RNA, then do all the clustering stuff?

```{r}
# These are now standard steps in the Seurat workflow for visualization and clustering
Ver_singlets_merged <- RunPCA(Ver_singlets_merged, verbose = FALSE)
Ver_singlets_merged <- RunUMAP(Ver_singlets_merged, dims = 1:30, verbose = FALSE)

Ver_singlets_merged <- FindNeighbors(Ver_singlets_merged, dims = 1:30, verbose = FALSE)
Ver_singlets_merged <- FindClusters(Ver_singlets_merged, verbose = FALSE)
DimPlot(Ver_singlets_merged, label = TRUE) + NoLegend()
```

## Harmony stuff

Need to check prerequisites for Harmony, as may not be the normalisation stuff I've done before.

## Ximerakis

Need to re-run ximerakis workflow with newly made Redux files
