## Plan today

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Need clustering info for verity to use Soup properly, run loading and clustering, then export that info?

Just need to make Seurat objects with ReadParseBio? one raw and one filtered, expects "DGE.mtx", "cell_metadata.csv", "all_genes.csv".

Ximerakis counts is being run atm with job ID 31060102, run multiqc and inspect the cellrangerMultiQC_Redux_1.html equivalent for summary stats and potential new cellranger output for that dataset.

## Getting clusters

Pre-treating and clustering the raw data. As shown [here](https://satijalab.org/seurat/articles/sctransform_vignette.html). This is taking over 650 GB of RAM, so adding glmGamPoi and verbose true for next run! Need to test a sub-set job and determine who much to use for an Eddie script.see [here](https://www.wiki.ed.ac.uk/display/ResearchServices/Memory+Specification) and [here](https://www.wiki.ed.ac.uk/display/ResearchServices/Parallel+Environments)

```{r}
Verity_total <- SCTransform(Verity_total, method = "glmGamPoi", verbose = TURE)

# These are now standard steps in the Seurat workflow for visualization and clustering
pbmc <- RunPCA(pbmc, verbose = FALSE)
pbmc <- RunUMAP(pbmc, dims = 1:30, verbose = FALSE)

pbmc <- FindNeighbors(pbmc, dims = 1:30, verbose = FALSE)
pbmc <- FindClusters(pbmc, verbose = FALSE)
DimPlot(pbmc, label = TRUE) + NoLegend()


```

Running a loop on a smaple basiss, starting object is labelled and not filtered ./Rdata/Verity_labelled_unfiltered.Rdata

The steps are taking long, so may add the [conserve.memory=TRUE](https://rdrr.io/github/satijalab/seurat/man/SCTransform.html)
